## x86 memory protection
- memory address translation
- this is so cool

## system security design approaches
- hierarchical structure (ring)
	- impossible to assign different privileges to processes at the same privilege level
	- performance issue due to message passing across different levels
- capability-based security
	- capability-base addressing (not adopted in mainstream systems)
	- high performance cost in simulated capability-based security
- hardware-based v.s. language-based protection
    - singularity by Microsoft Research
